# Strapi blog - rest & grapql

This is an experiment to get two identical frontends, using NextJS, up using the samebackend, but one uses graphql and the other uses REST.

There are some minor differences, but all in all it works.

## Develop

Clone the repo and run `yarn` in all three root folders to install the dependencies

Then run `yarn develop` in the backend folder

Then run `yarn dev` in both the frontend-rest folder and the frontend-graphql

Then you should be good to go ðŸš€
